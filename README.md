# Matplotlib-s_Challenge
In this assignment, we'll apply  Matplotlib to a (pharmaceutical) real-world situation and dataset

# Background
You've just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

This assignment is broken down into the following tasks:

Prepare the data.

Generate summary statistics.

Create bar charts and pie charts.

Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot.

Create a line plot and a scatter plot.

Calculate correlation and regression.

Submit your final analysis.

# Results
The total number of mice is 249, with one duplicate ID (g989) .By removing duplicates the total number of mice is 248. 
The bar graph showed the Drug Regimen Capomulin has the maximum mice number (230), and Zoniferol has the smaller mice number (182).
The total count of mice by gender also showed that 124 female mice and 125 male mice.
The correlation between mouse weight, and average tumor volume is 0.84 so we can say it is a strong positive correlation, when the mouse weight increases the average tumor volume also increases.
The regression analysis helped to understand how much the average tumor volume (dependent variable) will change when weight of mice change(independent variables).
